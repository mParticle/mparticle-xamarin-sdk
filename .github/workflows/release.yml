# Currently this workflow does not automatically pull in changes from development or create a git tag or Github "Release". First 
# make sure to manually create a release commit in master updating the version number in the `Library/mparticle.nuspec`
# file. Then run this workflow from master to build and release to nuget. After it's released to nuget, manually create a tag 
# and Github "Release" in the public repo pointing to the release commit.
