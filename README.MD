# mParticle Xamarin SDK

This is the repository of the mParticle Xamarin SDK, which is compatible with iOS and Android apps. The SDK consists of a common C# API layer and two Xamarin binding libraries for mParticle's native iOS and Android SDKs.

## Installation

This SDK is distributed via the public NuGet gallery: https://www.nuget.org/packages/mParticle.Xamarin/. 

If you have both an iOS and an Android project, you should add the NuGet package to each following the Xamarin Add Package dialog. [See here](https://developer.xamarin.com/guides/cross-platform/xamarin-studio/nuget_walkthrough/) for a detailed walkthrough on using NuGet with a Xamarin project.

```bash
Install-Package mParticle.Xamarin -Version 2.1.0
```

### mParticle Singleton

The mParticle.Xamarin package contains a class file `MParticle.cs`, which exposes the mParticle API via `MParticle.Instance`.

### Initialization

The SDK must be initialized with your mParticle workspace key and secret prior to use. This call should be placed in your Xamarin application initialization, *as early as possible*:

```cs
using mParticle.Xamarin;
namespace MyProject
{
    public class Example
    {
        void Example ()
        {
            //use the correct workspace API key and secret for iOS and Android
            string apiKey = "";
            string apiSecret = "";
            #if __ANDROID__
                apiKey = "REPLACE ME ANDROID KEY", ;
                apiSecret = "REPLACE ME ANDROID SECRET"
            #elif __IOS__
                apiKey = "REPLACE ME IOS KEY", ;
                apiSecret = "REPLACE ME IOS SECRET"         
            #endif
             
            new MParticleSDK().Initialize(new MParticleOptions()
            {
                ApiKey = apiKey,
                ApiSecret = apiSecret
            });
        }
    }
}
```

### Events

Events are central to many of mParticle's integrations; analytics integrations typically require events, and you can create mParticle Audiences based on the recency and frequency of different events.

#### App Events

App Events represent specific actions that a user has taken in your app. At minimum they require a name and a type, but can also be associated with a free-form dictionary of key/value pairs.

```cs
MParticle.Instance.LogEvent (
        "Hello world", 
        EventType.Navigation, 
        new Dictionary<string, string>{{ "foo", "bar" }}
);
```
#### Commerce Events

The `CommerceEvent` is central to mParticle's eCommerce measurement. `CommerceEvents` can contain many data points but it's important to understand that there are 3 core variations:

- Product-based: Used to measure datapoints associated with one or more products
- Promotion-based: Used to measure datapoints associated with internal promotions or campaigns
- Impression-based: Used to measure interactions with impressions of products and product-listings

Here's an example of a Product-based purchase event:

```cs
Product[] products = new Product[2];
products[0] = new Product("foo name", "foo sku", 42, 2);
products[0].Brand = "foo brand";
products[0].Category = "foo category";
products[0].CouponCode = "foo coupon";

products[1] = new Product("foo name 2", "foo sku 2", 100, 3);
products[1].Brand = "foo brand 2";
products[1].Category = "foo category 2";
products[1].CouponCode = "foo coupon 2";

TransactionAttributes transactionAttributes = new TransactionAttributes("foo transaction id");
transactionAttributes.Revenue = 180;
transactionAttributes.Shipping = 10;
transactionAttributes.Tax = 15;
transactionAttributes.Affiliation = "foo affiliation";
transactionAttributes.CouponCode = "foo coupon code";
CommerceEvent eCommEvent = new CommerceEvent (
    ProductAction.Purchase, 
    products, 
    transactionAttributes
);
MParticle.Instance.LogCommerceEvent(eCommEvent);       
```
#### Screen events

```cs
MParticle.Instance.LogScreenEvent
(
    "Test screen", 
    new Dictionary<string, string>{{ "Test key 1", "Test value 1" }}
);
```

### Identity

Version 2 of the MParticle Xamarin SDK supports the full range of Identity Sync features. For more indepth information about MParticle's Identity features, checkout either the [Android docs](http://docs.mparticle.com/developers/sdk/android/identity/) or the [iOS docs](http://docs.mparticle.com/developers/sdk/ios/identity) on the topic


#### Accessing IdentityApi

To get a reference to the IdentityApi

```cs
var identityApi = MParticle.Instance.Identity;
```

#### Updating Identities 


User identities allow you to associate specific identifiers with the current user: 

```cs
identityApi.CurrentUser.UserIdentities.Add(UserIdentity.CustomerId, "customerId");
identityApi.CurrentUser.UserIdentities.Remove(UserIdentity.Email);

identityApi.Modify(new IdentityApiRequest(identity.CurrentUser));
```

or

```cs
identityApi.Modify(new IdentityApiRequest() 
                {
                    UserIdentities = new Dictionary<UserIdentity, string>()
                    {
                        { UserIdentity.CustomerId, "" }
                    }
                });
```

In addition to this, the underlying iOS and Android SDKs will automatically collect device IDs.

#### User Attributes

User attributes allow for free form description of a user for segmentation and analytics:

```cs
identityApi.CurrentUser.UserAttributes.Add("foo attribute", "bar value");
```

```cs
identityApi.CurrentUser.SetUserTag("foo tag");
```

```cs
identityApi.CurrentUser.UserAttributes.Remove("foo attribute");
```

#### Identity Change Callbacks

Since the IdentityApi calls `identify`, `login()`, `logout()`, and `modify` are asynchronous, you can register a callback for the results of the request

```
 identityApi.Logout()
         .AddSuccessListener(success => Console.WriteLine(success.User.UserAttributes))
         .AddFailureListener(failure => Console.WriteLine("HttpCode = " + failure.HttpCode + "/nErrors = " + failure.Errors));
```

#### User Aliasing

When a new User is returned through and IdentityApi request, you may want to transition the SDK and data from the previous user to the new user.

```
identityApi.Login(new IdentityApiRequest()
            {
                UserAliasHandler = (previousUser, newUser) => 
                {
                    // do some stuff, but for example:
                    var persistentAttribute = "persistent user attribute";
                    if (previousUser.UserAttributes.ContainsKey(persistentAttribute))
                    {
                        newUser.UserAttributes.Add(persistentAttribute, previousUser.UserAttributes.GetValueOrDefault(persistentAttribute));
                    }
                }
            });
```

## Kit Integrations

While most of mParticle's integration are server side, several require additional client side libraries called kits. An mParticle Kit is composed of a class that typically wraps a 3rd-party SDK, and maps the mParticle API onto a that SDK's API.

**Android**

1. Create a new Xamarin Android binding project
2. Find the required Kit aar/artifact by navigating to the [mParticle Core repository](https://github.com/mParticle/mparticle-android-sdk#kits), which links to all kits on Maven Central.
3. Download the aar file directly from Maven Central.
2. Add the `.aar` file to the Jars folder and set the build action to LibraryProjectZip.
3. View the `POM` of the kit Maven artifact to see if it specifies a transitive dependency. Most kits specify a transitive dependency on a 3rd-party SDK.
3. Download the `.jar` or `.aar` file of the transitive dependency:
   * If this file is a jar, you can add to the same binding project in the Jars folder and set the build action to EmbeddedReferenceJar.
   * If the file is an aar, another binding project must be made and referenced by the kit binding project. (This is due to a limiting of Xamarin bindings).
4. Reference the binding project in your main Xamarin application.

To verify that the kit was successfully detected, look for a string that matches "[Service Provider Name] kit detected" so for instance "AppsFlyer Detected"

**iOS**

1. Compile a static version of the kit library that targets i386 and x86_64. All our kits are open source [located here](https://github.com/mparticle-integrations).
2. Compile or retrieve a static version of the service provider's library
3. You can add these as NativeReferences to your Xamarin iOS application

- iOS: https://developer.xamarin.com/guides/ios/troubleshooting/mtouch-errors/

## Building this project

If you do not use NuGet in your Xamarin project, you can build this project manually:

1. Open the `.sln` file in Xamarin Studio, select `Release and Build`. Alternatively, run `msbuild mParticle.Xamarin.sln /p:Configuration=Release /t:Rebuild` from a terminal.
4. (Optional) Go to to the Library folder and run `nuget pack`. This will create the NuGet package.

## Testing install referrer on Android

In order for attribution, deep linking, and many other integrations to work properly, add the mParticle `ReferrerReceiver` to your manifest file within the `<application>` tag. The mParticle SDK will collect any campaign referral information and automatically forward it to kits (such as AppsFlyer, Kochava, and Adjust) and server-side integrations.

```xml
<receiver android:name="com.mparticle.ReferrerReceiver" android:exported="true">
    <intent-filter>
        <action android:name="com.android.vending.INSTALL_REFERRER"/>
    </intent-filter>
</receiver>
```

To test if the install referrer is working, run the following in the terminal: 
`adb shell`
`am broadcast -a com.android.vending.INSTALL_REFERRER -n com.companyname.SampleAndroid/com.mparticle.ReferrerReceiver --es "referrer" "utm_source=test_source\&utm_medium=test_medium\&utm_term=test_term\&utm_content=test_content\&utm_campaign=test_name"`

Then go to the mParticle Live Stream, click on the Android - Batch, click View Event and you should see your value in the device info.
